The SWF Activity Module is the most flexible, functional, robust and powerful way to deploy Flash animations and applications in Moodle 1.9. It supports any version of Flash and Actionscript.

    Upload the /mplayer/ directory and all its contents to ***YOUR MOODLE***/mod/
    Make sure that the directory structure isn't ***YOUR MOODLE***/mod/mplayer/mplayer/... It should be ***YOUR MOODLE***/mod/mplayer/...
    In Moodle, login as an administrator
    Go to Site Administration > Notifications
    The Media Player will install/update itself
    If any settings have been changed, you'll be asked to save the settings on the Site Administration > Modules > Activities > Media Player page
    That's it!

Design Notes
===============

The .stm format

STM files are manifests that are used as proxy descriptors for remotely dispatched medias. 
the effective media file may be stored into an extra storage out of control of Moodle and
may be delivered from a streamed URL. the manifest file should be usually built by the MPlayer 
module, after a media upload. the manifest file is an XML file with a simple internal schema :

<XML version="1.0">
<Video>
    <Source>
        <streamer>wowza</streamer>
        <streamerurl>rtmp://medias.mysite/com</streamerurl>
        <appication>/vod</application>
        <clip>0</clip>
        <location>mp4:streamedfile.mp4</location>
    </Source>
</Video>
